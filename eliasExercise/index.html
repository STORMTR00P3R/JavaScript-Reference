            <!-- First exercise -->
            
            <h2 id="headerElement">[ENTER TITLE HERE]</h2>

            <!-- Second exercise -->
            <p>Change the following paragraph element to 3-5 sentences about when and how JavaScript was created.</p>
            <p id="paragraphElement">avaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

            <!-- Third exercise -->
            <p>Create a div using JavaScript <em>only</em> and save it to a variable called <code>myDiv</code>.</p>
            <p>Using only JavaScript, add the following style attributes:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A red border (make it 4px thick)</li>
                <li>A height of 100px</li>
                <li>A width of 100px</li>
                <li>A background color of green</li>
                <li>A border-radius of 15px</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you're done, and you've read this, please type <code>Adele > FIFTY FIFTY</code> in the chat.</p>
